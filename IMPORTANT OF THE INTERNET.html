          <h1 align="center"><b>IMPORTANT OF THE INTERNET</b></h1>
   <P align="center">Computer science have many uses and is now one of the most important subject in the world since all the world is now digitalise. So the piont will be stated as follow progressively</p>
        <h3>1-EASY RESEARCH</h3>
   <p align="left">Computer science or digitalisation have easy research for both student and workers in such a way that the can easyly find what they are looking on the internet using a browser</p>
        <h3 >2-FASTER COMMUNICATION</h3>
   <p align="left">This is also one critical use of the internet since years ago our parent in different countries to communicate was using post letters but today due to the internet, they can communicate easyly using WHATSAPP, FACEBOOK e.t.c
        <h3>3-FASTER MESAGING</h3>
   <p align="left">This simply tell us that thanks to the internet we can send message to our friends in all the world easyly and faster. for more information vist our web site </p>
          <a href="default.html"><i><b>www.internet.com</b></i></a>
          <h1 align="center"><b>DISADVANTAGE OF THE INTERNET</b></h1>
   <p align="center"> here i shall not explain the pionts but just state the major ones so that with the understanding of the word you can try to explain it but i am ready to answer all question not understood. You can send all your question in the gmail account below.The piont include:</p>
        <h3>1-SCAMMING</h3>
        <h3>2-SPAMMING</h3>
        <h3>3-PROVISION OF FALLS INFORMATION IF NOT VIGILENT</h3>
        <h3>4-VERRY DISORGANISED</h3><p></p>
      <h4 align="left">so after all these advantage and disadvantage of using the internet, we shall  forcus on the different type of logic gate. As we know we have 7 type of logic gate but i shall not draw them but just talk about them in bref showing you the important thing when drawing each logic gate.As i further said there are 7 type of logic gate and they include AND, OR, NOT,NOR, NAND, X-OR, X-NOR respetively. Logic gate understan only two number 1(for treu) and 0(for false). Also not to forget all logic gate have two input except the NOT gate which have 1 input</h4>
          <h1 align="center">TYPES OF LOGIC GATE</h1>
        <h3 align="left"><b>1-AND GATE</b></h3>
   <p><i>The AND gate(always write the name of the gate in capital letter), is a logic gate which have the principle of multiplication that is"the output is true when all the input are true i.e for the out put to be 1 all the input must be 1 and other condision implies that the out is 0(false). Another way to have the answer you can still multiply the two input cause 1*0=0(treu false is false)or 1*1=1(treu treu is treu) and you can continue with the other output.</i></p>   
        <h3 align="left"><b>2-OR GATE</b></h3>
   <p><i>The OR gate is a gate that deal with the principle of addition. for the output of an OR gate to be treu one of the input must be treu otherwise the output is false.we can still use our prinsiple which said 1+0=1(treu false is treu)1+1=1(we know mathe maticaly this not correct but remember that up i told you logic gate under stand only two numbers 1 and 0. this means treu treu in the OR gate is treu.</i></p>
